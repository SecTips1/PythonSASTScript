# Below is an example Python script that performs a simple static analysis to look for:

- Hardcoded credentials
- Outdated libraries (by comparing against the latest versions on PyPI)
- Insecure function calls

Keep in mind that this script is not a replacement for more comprehensive security tools (e.g., Bandit, Semgrep, Safety, etc.). However, it's a good starting point for demonstration purposes or smaller projects. You can place this script in your repository and run it from the command line to scan your codebase.

How to Use
Add the script: Copy this file (static_analysis.py) into your repository’s root.
Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install requests pkg_resources
(These are likely already installed in many Python environments, but ensure they’re present.)
```

Make it executable (optional):
```bash
chmod +x static_analysis.py
```

Run the script:
```bash
./static_analysis.py
```
or

```bash
python static_analysis.py
View the output: The script will report suspicious patterns found in your code (e.g., potential hardcoded credentials or insecure function calls) and libraries that may be outdated in your requirements.txt.
```
